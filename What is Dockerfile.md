Let's break it down step by step in simpler terms:

### 1. What is a Dockerfile?

- **Dockerfile is a text file** that contains instructions for Docker to build an image.
- **It is not a command** you run in your command prompt. Instead, you give it to Docker to read and build an image.

### 2. Where is your Dockerfile?

- Your file is located at:  
  `C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker\Dockerfile`

### 3. How to build your Docker image from the Dockerfile

**Step 1:** Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash).

**Step 2:** Navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located by typing:
```bash
cd C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker
```

**Step 3:** Run the following command to build your Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t my-hello-world .
```
- **What this does:**  
  - `docker build` tells Docker to create an image.
  - `-t my-hello-world` names (tags) your image "my-hello-world".
  - The dot `.` means "look in the current folder for the Dockerfile."

### 4. How to run your Docker container

Once the image is built, run it with:
```bash
docker run my-hello-world
```
- This command creates a container from your image and runs it.
- You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed in your terminal.

### Summary

- **Don't try to run the Dockerfile directly** (like a command).  
- **Instead, use `docker build`** to turn your Dockerfile into an image.
- **Then use `docker run`** to run the image in a container.

### Visual Walkthrough

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Type `cmd` in the Windows search bar and hit enter.

2. **Change Directory:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

3. **Build the Image:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     docker build -t my-hello-world .
     ```
   - Press **Enter** and wait for the build to finish.

4. **Run the Container:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     docker run my-hello-world
     ```
   - Press **Enter** and see "Hello, World!" on the screen.
