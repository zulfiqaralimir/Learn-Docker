Let's break it down step by step in simpler terms:

### 1. What is a Dockerfile?

- **Dockerfile is a text file** that contains instructions for Docker to build an image.
- **It is not a command** you run in your command prompt. Instead, you give it to Docker to read and build an image.

### 2. Where is your Dockerfile?

- Your file is located at:  
  `C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker\Dockerfile`

### 3. How to build your Docker image from the Dockerfile

**Step 1:** Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash).

**Step 2:** Navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located by typing:
```bash
cd C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker
```

**Step 3:** Run the following command to build your Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t my-hello-world .
```
- **What this does:**  
  - `docker build` tells Docker to create an image.
  - `-t my-hello-world` names (tags) your image "my-hello-world".
  - The dot `.` means "look in the current folder for the Dockerfile."

### 4. How to run your Docker container

Once the image is built, run it with:
```bash
docker run my-hello-world
```
- This command creates a container from your image and runs it.
- You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed in your terminal.

### Summary

- **Don't try to run the Dockerfile directly** (like a command).  
- **Instead, use `docker build`** to turn your Dockerfile into an image.
- **Then use `docker run`** to run the image in a container.

### Visual Walkthrough

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Type `cmd` in the Windows search bar and hit enter.

2. **Change Directory:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     cd C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

3. **Build the Image:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     docker build -t my-hello-world .
     ```
   - Press **Enter** and wait for the build to finish.

4. **Run the Container:**
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     docker run my-hello-world
     ```
   - Press **Enter** and see "Hello, World!" on the screen.

------------------------------

This error means that Docker can't find a file named **Dockerfile** in the current directory. Let's troubleshoot this step by step.

### 1. Verify the File Exists

1. **Check the File Name:**  
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```batch
     dir
     ```
   - Make sure you see an entry named exactly **Dockerfile** (without any extension like `.txt` or `.dockerfile`).

2. **Confirm It’s a File, Not a Directory:**  
   - In the output, **Dockerfile** should not be marked as `<DIR>`. If it is, then you have a directory instead of a file.

### 2. Create or Rename the Dockerfile

If you don't see the file or it's named incorrectly:

1. **Create a New Dockerfile:**  
   - Open a text editor like Notepad.
   - Paste the following content:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM alpine:latest
     CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
     ```
   - Save the file as **Dockerfile** in `C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker`.  
     **Important:**  
     - Ensure the file is saved as **Dockerfile** with no extension. In Notepad, you might need to select "All Files" in the "Save as type" dropdown.

2. **Rename if Needed:**  
   - If you have a file like `Dockerfile.txt`, rename it to just **Dockerfile**.

### 3. Re-run the Build Command

Once you've confirmed that the **Dockerfile** exists in your current directory, run:
```batch
docker build -t my-hello-world .
```
This command tells Docker to use the **Dockerfile** in the current directory to build your image.

### 4. Next Steps

- **If the build is successful:**  
  Run your container using:
  ```batch
  docker run my-hello-world
  ```
  You should see the output:
  ```
  Hello, World!
  ```

- **If you still see an error:**  
  Double-check the file name and location. Make sure you're in the right folder:
  ```batch
  cd C:\Users\STONE\hello-docker
  ```
  And then list the contents:
  ```batch
  dir
  ```

---------------------------

Since your file is named `Dockerfile.txt` instead of `Dockerfile`, Docker can't recognize it as the build file. You need to rename it so that it has no extension. Here’s how you can do that:

### Renaming the File

1. **Using Command Prompt:**

   In your Command Prompt, run:
   ```batch
   ren Dockerfile.txt Dockerfile
   ```
   This command renames `Dockerfile.txt` to `Dockerfile`.

2. **Verify the Rename:**

   List the directory contents again by typing:
   ```batch
   dir
   ```
   You should now see a file named `Dockerfile` (with no extension).

### Build Your Docker Image

Now that your Dockerfile is correctly named, build your image by running:
```batch
docker build -t my-hello-world .
```

### Run Your Docker Container

After the image builds successfully, run it with:
```batch
docker run my-hello-world
```

You should see:
```
**Hello, World!**
```
